                 I am Krithika Subramanian living in Dunwoody, Georgia and originally from the southern part of India.
                Currently I am pursuing Masters in Information Technology from Kennesaw State University. I have worked as a Business Analyst for almost 4 years in India.

                I have worked in HTML and CSS in my previous work. I have a limited exposure towrads the AngualrJS. I tried my hands on Data and realised I quiet am not a Data person, 
                and so I decided to gain more experience in Web/ Full Stack development. I really enjoyed and still enjoy creating websites.
